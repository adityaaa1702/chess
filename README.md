## Examples

### Example 1: Marking Valid Moves for a Rook

Enter the chess piece (e.g., 'R' for rook, 'N' for knight): R
Enter the position of the chess piece (e.g., 'a1', 'e4'): a1

The chessboard will be displayed with valid moves marked for the rook at position a1.

### Example 2: Marking Valid Moves for a Knight

Enter the chess piece (e.g., 'R' for rook, 'N' for knight): N
Enter the position of the chess piece (e.g., 'a1', 'e4'): e4

The chessboard will be displayed with valid moves marked for the knight at position e4.
